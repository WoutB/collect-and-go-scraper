# Collect & Go Scraper

ðŸ”¥ Since the country went into lockdown, people started hamstering and our beloved collect&go system was constantly overloaded. It's a webshop where you just order your groceries & pick a time to pick them up at the store. But since the Covid.19 outbreak, everyone got into this service which made us go to the stores ourselves.. ðŸŽª

## Business case

After a couple of weeks, Colruyt released a table containing all store locations and if they have open spots for pickup or not. This seemed like the perfect use case for my first webscraping application! 

I started by finding one of the easiest webscraping tools: puppeteer! After a couple of minutes I got my first scrape and I was hooked! I quit the tutorial and started implementing it for my case.

My first page immidately got labeled as a bot, but I came prepared, I knew this would happen. So I auto-filled some data the website needed to verify that I'm human ðŸ˜ˆ 

But the next page suddenly became the best detective ever and blocked my browser..
